Taking their cues from their frontman, Pink Floyd began doing away with the R&B covers that were being imitated by countless other bands from the era and embracing original sounds. And the highly intelligent Barrett, already known for marching to his own peculiar beat, began heavily ingesting LSD and producing song lyrics that were seemingly pulled from unknown realms of the cosmos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was that combination of original music, stage presentation and lyrical prowess that captured the attention of record companies in the first place, but by the time Pink Floyd was being presented as the next big thing in British rock, Barrett was already losing his tenuous grasp on reality through his incessant drug use.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His old friend and eventual replacement David Gilmour noticed as much when he dropped by the Chelsea Studios in May 1967 for the recording of the band's second single, "See Emily Play."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"Syd didn't seem to recognize me and just stared back," Gilmour recalled in Crazy Diamond. "I got to know that look pretty well and I'll go on record as saying that was when he changed. It was a shock. He was a different person."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The band's initial success gave way to uneasiness over Barrett's behavior</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the mounting worries about their friend's mental health, Pink Floyd was thriving. "See Emily Play" became a bigger hit than "Arnold Layne," reaching No. 6 on the British charts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Furthermore, Barrett had delivered a string of brilliant songs for the group's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. "Chapter 24" was inspired by I Ching, the ancient Chinese text, "Astronomy Domine" and "Interstellar Overdrive" became emblematic of the group's atmospheric sound and "Bike" showcased its writer's willingness to embrace the absurd.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, it wasn't long after Piper landed in record stores in early August 1967 that Barrett's deteriorating state began causing headaches for his bandmates. Later that month, it was reported that the drug-addled frontman was suffering from "nervous exhaustion," forcing the group to cancel its planned appearance at the National Jazz and Blues Festival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time the band departed for a U.S. tour in the fall, it was clear that Barrett's public presence was becoming a major problem. He stood on stage, detuning his guitar, during a gig at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and stared catatonically at the hosts during appearances on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/dick-clark data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dick Clark's American Bandstand" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dick Clark's American Bandstand</a> and The Pat Boone Show. Alarmed, the band's managers aborted the tour to avoid additional embarrassing incidents.</p><img alt="Syd Barrett" title="Syd Barrett" width=1509 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/syd-barrett-gettyimages-85513227.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Syd Barrett; Photo: Andrew Whittuck/Redferns</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Barrett's ongoing unpredictability forced the band to replace him</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, Barrett was under pressure to produce a successful follow-up single to "See Emily Play." "Scream Thy Last Scream" and "Vegetable Man" were deemed too dark for release, and while "Apples and Oranges" finally got the go-ahead in mid-November, it lacked the catchiness of its predecessors and flopped.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The group headed out for a U.K. tour around this time, with Barrett causing more tension by either refusing to exit the tour bus at gigs or walking off before the start of a show. Following a disastrous appearance at a Christmas concert, the band reached out to Gilmour, then fronting another struggling group called Jokers Wild.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Entering 1968 with intentions of continuing as a five-piece band, Pink Floyd tried an arrangement in which Barrett would remain on board as a behind-the-scenes songwriter, before abandoning the idea of dealing with him altogether. By March 1968, Barrett was no longer with the band he co-founded and pushed to prominence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Within a few years, the remaining members of Pink Floyd were being celebrated as arena rock gods while Barrett's own musical career was finished, and he spent the rest of his life <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/syd-barrett-the-madcap-who-named-pink-floyd-243429/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="away from the public eye" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">away from the public eye</a>. His presence on the group's quirky early records serving as a reminder for what could have been a long and successful career for a unique, gifted artist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even though he was no longer a member, Barrett still had an impact on Pink Floyd, and the band’s ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here, was recorded as a tribute to their co-founder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJoqrKcXZeus77EratmqJmjuG6yy6iwnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html&text=How%20LSD%20Created%20and%20Destroyed%20His%20Career%20With%20Pink%20Floyd&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html&title=How%20LSD%20Created%20and%20Destroyed%20His%20Career%20With%20Pink%20Floyd" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html&title=How%20LSD%20Created%20and%20Destroyed%20His%20Career%20With%20Pink%20Floyd" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html&title=How%20LSD%20Created%20and%20Destroyed%20His%20Career%20With%20Pink%20Floyd" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsyd-barrett-pink-floyd.html&description=How%20LSD%20Created%20and%20Destroyed%20His%20Career%20With%20Pink%20Floyd" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./suspicious-minds-elvis-presley-lyrics-meaning.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Story of...
