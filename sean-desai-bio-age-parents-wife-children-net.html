In 2010, he assumed the role of special teams coordinator for the Owls, marking an early stage in his coaching journey.</p><p>In 2011, Desai took on the role of assistant director of football operations at the University of Miami, expanding his experience and network in the world of football.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The year 2012 saw Desai joining Boston College as their running backs coach and special teams coordinator, further honing his skills and expertise in coaching.</p><p>In 2013, <a href=# rel=noopener>Desai</a> made the leap to the NFL, where he was hired by the Chicago Bears as a quality control assistant under head coach Marc Trestman. In this capacity, he worked closely with the Bears’ defensive backs and linebackers, while also contributing to the special teams coaching staff. Over the years, he continued to excel, retaining his position under head coaches John Fox in 2015 and Matt Nagy in 2018.</p><p>His dedication and contributions did not go unnoticed, and on February 8, 2019, he was promoted to safeties coach. His tenure with the Bears culminated with his appointment as the defensive coordinator on January 22, 2021, succeeding Chuck Pagano. This historic promotion marked him as the first individual of Indian descent to hold a coordinator position in the NFL. Despite this accomplishment, Desai departed the team after the conclusion of the 2021 season.</p><p>On February 11, 2022, Sean Desai entered a new chapter in his career by joining the Seattle Seahawks as an Associate Defensive Head Coach, bringing his expertise to a new NFL franchise.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His journey continued as he accepted the role of defensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles on February 28, 2023, under the leadership of head coach Nick Sirianni. This new position came as a result of the departure of Jonathan Gannon, who had been appointed as the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals. Desai’s addition to the Eagles’ coaching staff signified his continued commitment to the NFL and his determination to make an impact on the field.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Sean Desai’s journey extends beyond the football field. He holds an impressive academic record, having earned his undergraduate degree in philosophy and political science, with a minor in biology, from Boston University in 2004. He continued his educational pursuits by obtaining a master’s degree in higher and postsecondary education from Columbia University in 2005.</p><p>Notably, Desai also earned a doctorate in educational administration from Temple University in 2008. His academic journey furthered his knowledge and understanding of the educational field, making him a well-rounded individual with both academic and athletic expertise. Additionally, he served as an adjunct professor for two years, sharing his knowledge and insights with the next generation of leaders.</p><p>Sean Desai’s remarkable career as an NFL coach, combined with his educational background, highlights his multifaceted approach to life and his commitment to the development of both athletes and students.
