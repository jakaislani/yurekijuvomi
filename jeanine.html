It feels like just yesterday that I was sitting here writing about last year‚Äôs top recipes, and here we are again. 2018 was a busy one‚Ä¶ we settled into our Chicago home and cooked up a storm of yummy food. We have some exciting things happening in 2019, but before we get there, here are the greatest hits of this past year. I think it‚Äôs fun to check our analytics to see which of your favorite recipes were also my favorite recipes‚Ä¶ and this list really aligns.

At least, that‚Äôs what I tell myself as I seriously consider getting one of those vitamin D lamps. Have any of you ever tried one? These 4:30 Chicago sunsets really take some getting used to. Anyway, back to the cauliflower salad! I was going to save this recipe to post in January. You know, once everyone wants to get healthy and eat vegetables again‚Ä¶ but then I realized that you‚Äôre all here because you love vegetables, holidays or not! This hearty cauliflower salad could double as a holiday side dish‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This roasted red pepper soup recipe is light and nourishing, yet creamy and delicious ‚Äì just the thing if you ate too many cookies this weekend. Plus, I think the red pepper soup and green herbs look so festive! If you haven‚Äôt gotten around to decorating a tree this year (or if you‚Äôre tired of decorating cookies), you can decorate your soup! üôÇ Roasted Red Pepper Soup Recipe Ingredients Because red bell peppers aren‚Äôt in season, I use jarred roasted red peppers, which are a super convenient pantry ingredient.

We‚Äôve made this dip so many times over the past few weeks perfecting the recipe. I have to tell you that it‚Äôs been such a joy because it‚Äôs FREEZING outside and there is truly no greater comfort in life than having a hot skillet of creamy, cheesy goodness bubbling and baking away in the oven. Ordinarily, I‚Äôd give ‚Äúparty dip‚Äù a bit of a sideways glance ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the who-knows-what ingredients plus a brick‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These tahini cookies have become one of my favorite afternoon treats. They‚Äôre soft and chewy, with a lightly sweet, spiced flavor. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôll be reaching for a second before you‚Äôve even finished the first. Luckily, there‚Äôs no need to hold back here, as these tahini cookies are actually on the healthy side. They‚Äôre vegan, gluten-free, and naturally sweetened, and the pomegranates on top add a pop of antioxidants! I mean‚Ä¶why not have three?

This orange shortbread cookie recipe is based on the lemon shortbread cookies that I made last year. That recipe is a fan favorite, so I thought I‚Äôd do a more festive version of it for Christmas. This time, I cut the cookies into stars and decorated them with orange zest and these cute Supernatural white sequin sprinkles. How to Make Orange Shortbread Want to learn how to make these cookies?

Today we‚Äôre celebrating with this bright red & green sun dried tomato pasta. I have a confession to make. I‚Äôm really terrible at decorating for the holidays. Some years it happens, others it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and then some years we end up with a Valentine‚Äôs Day tree because we lose track of time and the work of taking down decorations is far less fun than putting them up. So here‚Äôs my version of holiday greenery for you ‚Äì sun dried tomato pasta!

They have that bakery-perfect chewy middle with a lightly crisp edge and a lovely balance of light and bright citrus flavor. I‚Äôll be making them on repeat throughout the holiday season, but honestly, these lemon cookies are so delicious that I would happily take one any day of the year. This lemon cookie recipe comes from my friend Melissa Coleman‚Äôs book The Minimalist Kitchen. You may know of her blog, The Faux Martha.

I hope you all had a great meal and a relaxing long weekend. Me? I‚Äôve been a busy bee putting the finishing touches on this new ‚ÄúShop‚Äù section of our website so that we could launch it before Black Sunday or Cyber Monday or whatever-the-heck these gift-crazy days are called. I typically write some sort of gift guide post around this time of year, but this time I‚Äôm doing things a little bit differently. Here‚Äôs why!

If you ask me, it‚Äôs the best kind of comfort food. It‚Äôs creamy and cozy, but it‚Äôs nourishing too. Colorful autumn veggies like carrots, celery, and mushrooms fleck its surface, and nutty wild rice and white beans make it nice and hearty. And as for that creamy broth? Well, there‚Äôs actually no heavy cream or dairy hiding inside it. Instead, it‚Äôs a wholesome, flavorful blend of white beans, cashews,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Saturday! I‚Äôm popping in today to share one more fall squash recipe that would make for a tasty Thanksgiving side dish (or a tasty any-dinner side dish if you don‚Äôt celebrate T-giving!). This one is a little bit different for me because I haven‚Äôt been a big fan of blue cheese. That is, until a few weeks ago, when Jack and I shared a squash dish with blue cheese at the Publican (here in Chicago) that I was completely enamored with.
