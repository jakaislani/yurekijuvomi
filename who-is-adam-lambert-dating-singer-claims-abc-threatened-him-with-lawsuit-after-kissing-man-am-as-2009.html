Lambert gained immense popularity after his stint in Season 8 of '<a href=# rel>American Idol'</a> in 2009, where he emerged as a runner-up. He also rose to fame for selling over three million albums and five million singles globally. In 2011, he joined hands with the team of the popular rock band 'Queen' to become the lead vocalist of the Queen + Adam Lambert banner. Lambert reportedly claimed that ABC threatened to file a law suit against him after he kissed a male musician while performing on stage at the 2009 American Music Awards, sparking outrage.</p><p>While speaking at the 2023 Creative Coalition Spotlight Initiative Gala on January 21, Lambert said, "I did the kind of performance I’d seen since I was a teenager. I was like, I want to be sexy and have dancers on stage, and I did a couple of suggestive moves with some of my dancers and an impromptu kiss... I was feeling it," as reported by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>. He added that the network banned him for a while and threatened him with a&nbsp;<a href=# rel>lawsuit</a>. He said, "I didn’t know. I lived in a bubble in LA amongst artists and weirdos, and I didn’t realize that kind of thing ruffled feathers the way it did. I’m going to be as gay as I f*****g can be and be flamboyant and be wild and if it gets me into trouble, it gets me into trouble. I’m not going to back down from it." During the 2009 performance, Lambert also simulated <a href=# rel>oral sex</a> with a dancer, which led to the network receiving around 1,500 complaints.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Charlie Puth and Brooke Sansone seen making out as engagement rumors swirl</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Opera soprano Danielle de Niese describes Meghan Markle's claims of racism in UK 'very disturbing'</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Adam Lambert dating?</h2><p>Lambert is currently dating Oliver Gliese, 27, the duo was spotted kissing each other on 17 November, 2020, near a beach in Tulum, Mexico, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Teal Mango</a>.
