After he was arrested, authorities searched his home and not only found Worden's decapitated body but also a museum of horrors they couldn't possibly imagine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Inside Gein's farmhouse was an array of human body parts: skulls used as bed posts, waste baskets and chair seats made of human skin, nine salted vulvas in a shoebox, leggings made from leg skin, a belt made out of nipples and face masks made from female skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After admitting to the murders of both <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ed-gein-kills-final-victim-bernice-worden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bernice Worden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bernice Worden</a> and tavern owner Mary Hogan — the latter whom he killed in 1954 — Gein revealed that the rest of the body parts scattered about in his house came from stealing female corpses from local cemeteries. His goal? To make a body suit made of human flesh in order to slink back into his mother's skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein was deemed legally insane and institutionalized at a psychiatric ward in Wisconsin. In 1984 he died of cancer and respiratory problems at the age of 77. He was buried at his family plot in an unmarked grave.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The revelations of Gein's demented compulsions changed America forever and inspired a slew of horror films — a few that have achieved icon status.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Psycho' (1960)</h2><img alt="Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates" title="Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/psycho-photo-by-ullstein-bild_ullstein-bild-via-getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates in "Psycho"; Photo: ullstein bild/Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein's haunting infatuation with his mother has now become a trope for many demented horror characters who kill — take Norman Bates in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/alfred-hitchcock data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alfred Hitchcock's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alfred Hitchcock's</a> Psycho (1960) as a prime example. However, Bates wasn't taken directly taken from Gein, but instead from the imagination of novelist Robert Bloch. Still, there was a creepy connection: Bloch was actually writing his novel just 35 miles from where Gein lived. It was only right before he finished his book that Gein's murders came to light. Bloch was shocked at how closely Bates' actions and motivation resembled Gein's.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974)</h2><img alt="The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" title="The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo-by-ullstein-bild_ullstein-bild-via-getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">A scene from "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; Photo: ullstein bild/Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Very loosely inspired by Gein, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre took the real-life body snatcher's obsession with human skin and used it to build its character Leatherface, who hid behind face masks made out of human flesh. Although the film's family of murderers had no relation to Gein, other more conspicuous inspirations from the troubled man include body parts used as home decoration, the hint of cannibalism and the mummified carcass of the family's matriarch sitting in the house.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991)</h2><img alt="Ted Levine in The Silence of the Lambs" title="Ted Levine in The Silence of the Lambs" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-silence-of-the-lambs-ted-levine-1991-orion-pictures-corp_courtesy-everett-collection.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill in "The Silence of the Lambs"; Photo: ©Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The serial murderer Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs not only found origins in Gein but also from other famous serial murderers, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/ted-bundy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ted Bundy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ted Bundy</a>, Gary Heidnik and Ed Kemper. Buffalo Bill's obsession with female human flesh and making suits out of his victims' skin was a direct nod to Gein.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Three on a Meathook' (1972)</h2><img alt="Three on a Meathook" title="Three on a Meathook" width=1941 height=2961 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/three-on-a-meathook-1972.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">"Three on a Meathook" poster; Photo: LMPC/Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The title basically gives a lot away. Directed by horror filmmaker William Girdler, Three on a Meathook tells the story of four young ladies whose car breaks down in a small town. A local farm boy helps them out and ultimately lures them to his family's house where his killer father, Frank, waits to eat them. Like Gein, Frank has an obsession with his dead mother along with hanging his victims from meathooks, which Gein did to Worden's body. Although it was never proven that Gein ate his corpses, it was widely assumed that he did.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Deranged' (1974)</h2><img alt="Roberts Blossom in Deranged" title="Roberts Blossom in Deranged" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/deranged-roberts-blossom-1974.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Roberts Blossom as Ezra Cobb in "Deranged"; Photo: Everett Collection</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Deranged is perhaps one of the closest films that depict the life of Gein. The slasher comedy-drama centers around a middle-aged Midwestern farmer whose overly religious mother dies. He keeps her corpse around, and to satiate his dark desires, begins to rob corpses from the graveyard so that they can keep his dead mother company. Eventually, he turns to murder and enjoys skinning his victim's bodies and making face masks out of their flesh.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Ed and His Dead Mother' (1993)</h2><img alt="Ed and His Dead Mother" title="Ed and His Dead Mother" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anf4ffmjpijhz3foohltwclphfr.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">"Ed and His Dead Mother" poster;</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This 1993 dark comedy stars <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/steve-buscemi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve Buscemi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steve Buscemi</a> as Ed Chilton, whose hardware store owner mother dies, leaving him to inherit the business. A salesman offers to resurrect Ed's mother from the dead, to which Ed agrees. However, once she returns, Ed's mother isn't the same and like a proper zombie, seeks out human flesh to eat. Ed decides that bringing his mother back to life has become more of a burden than he can bear, and in the end, he decides to destroy her by decapitating her head.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Child of God' (2014)</h2><img alt="Child of God" title="Child of God" width=800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/child-of-god-2014-movie-poster.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">"Child of God" poster;</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A film co-directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/james-franco data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Franco" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Franco</a>, Child of God was an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 1973 book by the same name. Although McCarthy's book was inspired by a real-life murderer based in Tennessee, the character shared many similarities as Gein. In the film, the main character is a loner who lives in the middle of nowhere and whose necrophilia comes to life (and grows) after stumbling upon dead corpses in a car.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6GdmnymsIygnKKmXZ67tLzIq5ydZZikv7O70WakqK6ZmsA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html&text=7%20Horror%20Movies%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Body%20Snatcher%20and%20Murderer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html&title=7%20Horror%20Movies%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Body%20Snatcher%20and%20Murderer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html&title=7%20Horror%20Movies%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Body%20Snatcher%20and%20Murderer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html&title=7%20Horror%20Movies%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Body%20Snatcher%20and%20Murderer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-gein-inspired-horror-movies.html&description=7%20Horror%20Movies%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Body%20Snatcher%20and%20Murderer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashley-the-mogul-net-worth-289278.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley the Mogul Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danganronpa-episode-screenshots-released.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Screenshots For Danganronpa Another Episode Hit The Web">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
