through “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sons of Anarchy</a>.”</p><p>It is estimated that he earned over $8 million doing almost 92 episodes of his most hit series.</p><p>Also, he worked steadily on the TV series “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Queer as Folk</a>” and “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Undeclared</a>” and scored high viewers and positive responses.</p><p>Besides that, he possesses a number of mansions worth millions in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, and so on.</p><p>Additionally, he rented one of his bungalows for $ 6,500 per month.</p><p>He then continuously landed numerous small roles, movies crediting to his net worth. Also. he received a big payday for the “2020s The Gentleman”, with Matthew McConaughey and Hugh Grant.</p><p>Significantly, his net worth doubled dramatically during seven seasons of the FX drama “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sons of Anarchy</a>.”</p><h2>Charlie Hunnam: Houses, Motorcycles, and Cars</h2><h3>Houses</h3><p>Actor Charlie seems to have time for a house-hunt despite his busy schedule.</p><p>In the beginning, he bought a vintage estate and a restored Mediterranean-style house in the Hollywood Hills worth $ 2.7 Million.</p><p>This ancient house features four bedrooms, a rustic kitchen, and a stunning outdoor space.</p><p>Adding on, he also owns another LA pad purchased in 2002 for $ 695000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Charlie-Bunglow-300x169.jpg><p>Interestingly, he had planned to buy another property and rear a ranch too; however, he changed his mind at the last minute.</p><p>Further, he has chartered his bungalow in Fairfax at $ 6500 a month. Also, this bungalow is 1,500 square feet with a brick walkway, white marble and hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and two fireplaces.</p><h3>Motorcycles</h3><p>The British star who has been winning legions of fans drives the classic American Bike. Thus, he frequently rides around Los Angeles on his Harley Davidson motorcycle.</p><p>By all accounts, he likes bikes as much as his character in “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sons of Anarchy</a>.” In fact, he rides the same bike in real life as he did on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Hunnam-Bike-300x244.jpg><p>His choice of vehicle is a “<strong>Harley- Davidson Street Glide</strong>” motorcycle worth $20 399, and he mostly rode “Harley – Davidson Dyna Super Glide Sport” for the majority of the show.</p><p>Not only that, his love for motorcycles is dope, and his hit show got him to hang out with real bikers and MCs in the Oakland area before filming.</p><p>Even he has also been interested in making bikes since 1903.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Charlie also has plenty of cars though he mostly prefers to ride bikes. He possesses Jaguar and Charger- manufactured by Dodge worth $ 30000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Charlies-car-220x300.jpg><p>One of the reasons why Charlie prefers to bike to the car is to escape the traffic in Los Angeles.</p><p>Also, he expressed that in 2010, he put 8,500 miles on his bike and only&nbsp; 350 miles on his car. Therefore, driving 350 miles in one year is very minimal.</p><p>Even though he is a motorcycle enthusiast, he appeals to ride safely around L.A. for it’s a pretty dangerous place for motorcycles.</p><h2>Charlie Hunnam: Lifestyle and Favorites</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>The handsome hunk has the best New Year’s tradition: a habit of sleeping early on Eve in order to wake up early the next day to view the beautiful sunrise of the new year.</p><p>During his shooting of the documentary “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">End of the Line</a>,” which was about the effects of overfishing. Truly, he goes deeper into his character and content that he once gave up fish for about 18 months.</p><p>He always wants to live an abstruse life and prefers keeping his affairs private.</p><p>In 2016, he started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and received a blue belt in October 2018.</p><p>As a matter of fact, he grew up in a socially and economically depressed place. During his school life, he was an average guy, neither the coolest nor the happening typos.</p><p>Sadly, he was diagnosed with dyslexia which made reading a difficult task for him.</p><p>His big break “Byker Grove” came while he was drunk in a shoe store.</p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading about <a href=#>Brad Pitt Net Worth: House & Charity</a></strong>.</p><p>Also, Charlie smokes marijuana regularly. He admitted that he got hooked on smoking to lose weight for a role. Now, he is using e-cigarettes to fizzle out.</p><p>Humorously, he has developed a huge wardrobe not because of his shopping but by stealing clothes off of movies and off of Sons.</p><p>Though he does not have a personal trainer, he works out regularly at the gym. Thus, he runs 5 miles routinely and does 300 push-ups and 100 pull-ups.</p><h3>Favorites</h3><p>Handsome actor Charlie Hunnam likes to play Rugby and used to play a lot while growing up.</p><p>It is quite intriguing to say that he is fond of UFC fighters; if he weren’t an actor, he claims that he would certainly be a fighter.</p><p>Oddly, Charlie also is into cooking; he did a cooking course in Thailand. Thus,&nbsp; he knows Thai-style cooking.</p><p>Moreover, his favorite actors are <strong>Daniel Day-Lewis</strong> and <strong>Sean Penn</strong>.</p><p>To boot, he likes Harley’s motorbike because he can ride them aggressively. Riding bikes makes Charlie feel more engaged in the world, which he finds liberating in a way.</p><p>And, he often goes to track days and rides around 200 mph with other guys who can’t beat him.</p><p>He owns at least 85 pairs of Nike Airmax 90s.</p><p>When it comes to eating, Spaghetti Puttanesca and Chocolate Icecream are his favorite foods.
