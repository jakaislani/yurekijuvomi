They were married for over twenty years and were leading a happily-lived married life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/Screenshot-2023-06-22-at-10.55.56-PM-1687773144144.jpg><p>It was reported that Shahzada and Christine first met while studying at Reutlingen University in Germany. They might have developed romantic interests during their college years.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, Shahzada and Christine completed their wedding ceremony in 2001. They had no issues or misunderstandings which could lead them to take decisions of divorce.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shahzada's Wife's Details In Brief</h2><p>Christine Dawood was originally born Christine Meckel in Rosenheim, Germany, in 1977. Her parents are Mr.Meckel and Mrs. Meckel but additional information regarding them isn't discovered.&nbsp;</p><p>Christine is an entrepreneur, organizational psychologist, family-business insider, and executive coach.

His unfortunate death occurred during a submersible journey to view the Titanic wreckage.</p><p>The 19-year-old Alina's brother was scared of the adventurous journey as reported by his aunt in <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBC News</a>. However, he attended due to his father's deep fascination with the Titanic.</p><h2>What About The Net Worth Details Of Shahazada Dawood?</h2><p>Shahzada Dawood had an admirable net worth of at least <strong>$136.7 million</strong> similar to <a href=#><strong>Alvin Malnik</strong></a>. He made this massive wealth mostly through his successful career as a businessman and investor.&nbsp;</p><p>Shahzada used to be the vice-chairman at Engro Corporation and has served the corporation since 2003.

The other three people aboard the craft were <strong>Stockton Rush</strong>, Hamish Harding, and Paul-Henri Nargeolet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/200323-titan1-630x542-1687778032972.jpg><p>The OceanGate Titan submersible was a five-person vessel and 6.8 meters long.

People have raised issues about the safety and reliability of the hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;However, the use of the Logitech G F710 Wireless Gamepad is not the real issue for the implosion.
