During a road test, any driving faults you make will result in points being deducted from your score and recorded on a checklist. Some faults are worth five points, while others are worth ten. During the course of the exam, the same fault might be noted three times.</p><p></p><h3>How do you perform a three-point turn?</h3><p>To perform a three-point turn, begin by moving as far right as feasible, checking for traffic, and signalling a left. The steering wheel should be swung strongly to the left while moving ahead slowly.
