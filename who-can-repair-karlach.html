In order to do so you’ll need to employ the work of <b>a Tiefling blacksmith named Dammon</b>. He’s located in the Emerald Grove in the top corner at X:179, Y:562.</p><h2>How do I find a mechanic for Karlach?</h2><p>Players can initially find Dammon at X:178 Y:563 in the Hollow, an area that is adjacent to the Emerald Grove. Notably, fans that want to complete Karlach’s questline should make sure to kill the goblin leaders in Baldur’s Gate 3, as the infernal mechanic may not make it to his next location if they are left alive.</p><h2>Can Karlach be cured?</h2><p>Here is a quick feedback/suggestion I have: In a certain scene, Dammon tells Karlach that “there is a cure” for her engine. As someone with a chronic disease, I feel that the word CURE is disingenuous and misleading. As the game stands now, there is NO cure for Karlach.</p><h2>How do you repair Karlach’s heart in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><p>In order to repair Karlach’s heart, return to Dammon with Karlach in the party. Karlach has to install the upgrades herself, so this only works if Karlach is present. After the first upgrade, Karlach still feels hot, but not as bad as before. She feels more powerful than ever, but it’s not enough to solve the problem.</p><h2>How do you fix a karlachs chest?</h2><p>In the quest to upgrade Karlach’s heart, I just found Infernal metal and gave it to the Tieflin Smith. He crafted an upgrade and gave it to Karlach. She seemed to install it, as if she installed an USB stick : plug and play, 2 seconds.</p><h2>Baldur’s Gate 3 – Fixing Karlach’s Engine</h2><h2>Can you have both Karlach and Wyll?</h2><p>By following specific steps, players can save both Karlach and Wyll, continuing their personal quests without major consequences, while exploiting a fitting loophole in the game.</p><h2>Is Karlach good or bad?</h2><p>While there’s no alignment technically in BG3, Karlach is very obviously a good-aligned character. Honestly if you went full evil, she’d probably be the first person to outright try to kill you over it.</p><h2>Can Karlach get her heart back?</h2><p>If you choose her as your player character, you can get an ending where she fixes her heart.</p><h2>Can you not save Karlach?</h2><p>There is 100% a way to save karlach. There might not be a way to repair her heart entirely but it is possible for her to live past end credits at least.</p><h2>How do you save Karlach from dying?</h2><p>It seems that if Wyll becomes the blade of avernus she can take Karlach to avernus and save her from exploding.</p><h2>Does Karlach get a good ending bg3?</h2><p>While most of the cast can get an ending that’s fairly close to perfect, Karlach can’t. Either way, she’s missing something, and fans want that to change, calling on Larian to give her the ending she deserves.</p><h2>Can Karlach have a happy ending?</h2><p>She can have a downside–like still having Zariel chasing her to the ends of the universe–but be happy and able to live a life with love and possibilities in it. As players, we should be able to choose from a range of fates for Karlach spanning from happy to bittersweet to tragic.</p><h2>What is the best ending for Karlach?</h2><p>The final, and saddest, choice is unfortunately probably the best ending for Karlach. Players can fight alongside her to defeat the Netherbrain, but after the battle is over, Karlach will go out onto a dock and accept her fate, dying right there. She will die, but she will at least die as a hero and as herself.</p><h2>Can you get Karlach as a companion?</h2><p>Karlach is an Origin character in Baldur’s Gate 3. Origin characters are playable heroes who have their own stories, desires, and attitudes toward the world. You can play as Karlach to live out her story, or you can choose to create a custom character and recruit her as a companion instead.</p><h2>Should I befriend Karlach?</h2><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3 Karlach is a companion-to-be, a Tiefling barbarian freed from hell and the Blood War in Avernus who is actually being hunted by Wyll and the Paladin Anders. The Hunt the Devil quest has several outcomes, but frankly siding with Karlach is definitely the best one.</p><h2>Can you help Karlach in Act 3?</h2><p>If for some reason you miss Dammon in Act 2, or don’t have the Infernal Iron at the time, you can still find Dammon in Act 3 within the city of Baldur’s Gate at the Forge of the Nines at X:0, Y:-6, who will still be available to help upgrade Karlach’s Infernal Engine.</p><h2>How do you cool down Karlach?</h2><p>Back in your camp, talk to Karlach and say that you know of a way to cool her off. She’ll simply reply with “I’m waiting” and her dialogue will not change. To fix this, you can either throw water at her, cast a water or ice spell, or shoot an ice arrow.</p><h2>How do you get Karlach to become Mind Flayer?</h2><p>Make sure Karlach is in your active party when you go to the Morphic Pool. Later, once you talk to the Emperor, select: “Would I be able to wield…” or “I don’t care about Orpheus…” Karlach will suggest that she could become a Mind Flayer instead.</p><h2>Can you miss Karlach?</h2><p>If you progressed into Act two, then you missed her. Be wary of any zone-transition that the game throws a warning to you about progressing through, those are typically points of no return. I killed her and regret it. I’ll make sure to pick her up in my 2nd playthrough.</p><h2>Should you kiss Karlach?</h2><p>Any option here is okay, just as long as they’re not dismissive or rude. You’ll be given the option to share a kiss with her, but eventually, you pull away, and she’s worried that she hurt you. Afterward, you can pick an alternative night option, but none of them will work, and she’ll leave you for the night.</p><h2>Why won t Karlach join me?</h2><p>If you decide to raid the grove, Karlach will leave your party immediately. She will also not join your party if you’ve done this before recruiting her.</p><h2>What happens if you romance Karlach?</h2><p>Long-distance relationships aren’t Karlach’s thing, so if the player character wants to end up with her, they’ll have to make the move to Avernus with her at the game’s conclusion.</p><h2>Who should I replace with Karlach bg3?</h2><p>If you kill Anders and his band of not-so-merry folks, you can recruit Karlach to your party and she acts as a good replacement for Lae’zel as Karlach has a more well-rounded build.</p><h2>Can you romance Karlach if you are evil?</h2><p>Karlach obviously will not approve of embracing the urge, since she does not like evil characters.</p><h2>What do you get from killing Karlach?</h2><p>So, i did two acts 1 playthroughs, and in one i killed Karlach, and in the other i spared her. If you spare her, Wyll is transformed into a Devil, and if you kill her, You get a really cool armour piece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eoZJyZnmK%2FprzAoqlmo5GnuaKvx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html&text=Who%20can%20repair%20Karlach%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html&title=Who%20can%20repair%20Karlach%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html&title=Who%20can%20repair%20Karlach%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html&title=Who%20can%20repair%20Karlach%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-can-repair-karlach.html&description=Who%20can%20repair%20Karlach%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./derrick-coleman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Derrick Coleman">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-was-the-book-of-boba-fett-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where was The Book of Boba Fett filmed?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
