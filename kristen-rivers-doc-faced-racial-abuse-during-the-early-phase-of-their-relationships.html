Despite the abuses and difficulties, they were able to maintain their connection. Aside from that, Doc was exposed to racism throughout his tenure with the Clippers. A mysterious fire broke out at Kristen and Doc’s San Antonia home, where they lived with their children. The fire was thought to have been started out of racial animosity.</p><h2>Divorce is still pending.</h2><p>The pair are divorcing after more than three decades of marriage.&nbsp;According to the insider, they have been separated for about six years and have been in the process of divorcing for the last three years.&nbsp;Doc, on the other hand, hasn’t made his dating status public.</p><h2>Mother of four children</h2><p>Kristen is the delighted mother of four children: son Austin, 28, daughter Callie Rivers, 32, son Jeremiah, 32, and youngest son Spencer, 25.&nbsp;Her children are all athletes, with all of her boys playing professional basketball and her daughter Callie playing volleyball.&nbsp;Austin was a professional basketball player with the New York Knicks of the National Hoops Association (NBA), while Jeremiah played basketball at Georgetown and Indiana before joining the Maine Red Claws.&nbsp;Spencer is presently a guard for UC Irvine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kristen-Rivers-1.jpg><h2>Her daughter’s grand wedding</h2><p>On September 14, 2019, her daughter Callie married Seth Curry, a professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers.&nbsp;It was a beautiful wedding in Malibu, followed by a big celebration.&nbsp;Callie and Seth’s one-year-old daughter, as well as Seth’s two nieces Riley and Ryan, daughters of NBA star Steph Curry, acted as flower girls for the ceremony.&nbsp;The bride and groom hit the dance floor, making the event more exciting. Steph Curry was the best man.</p><h2>Who is the mysterious lady in Doc’s life?</h2><p>Doc seemed to have found a new lady in his life, despite the news of their impending divorce.
