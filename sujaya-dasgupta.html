The highly-rated series cast includes actors like Jessie Mei Li, Archie Renaux, Freedy Carter, Daisy Head, Gabriella Brooks, and more.</p><p>Dasgupta's net worth has been estimated to be <strong>$150,000 </strong>and her zodiac sign is Aquarius. The actress stands at a height of 5 Feet and 6 Inches<strong> </strong>(167 cm) and a weight of 121 lbs (<strong>55 kg</strong>).</p><h2>Relationship Status: The Actress Is Single</h2><p>Sujaya Dasgupta is not seeing anyone for now, in simpler words, she is single. She is relatively new in the world of movies and currently, she is giving all of her time to making her career. Her other time goes with her friends and family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/27/81768548_2580116835442860_6237855467057097275_n%20(1)-1679902195830.jpg><p>Dasgupta lives a low-key life and hasn't revealed much about herself, including her love life. The <i>Shadow and Bone </i>actress's previous relationship records are missing. She may be on social media but she doesn't post much which makes it difficult to learn about her.</p><h2>Net Worth Of The Shadow and Bone Actress</h2><p>Sujaya Dasgupta has an estimated net worth of <strong>$150,000</strong>. Acting is her primary source of income. Her wealth might not seem impressive to some. However, it should be taken into consideration that the actress is relatively new to the industry.</p><p>Dasgupta&nbsp;hasn't appeared in many movies and shows at the time of this writing. Her most successful work so far has been the TV series, <i>Shadow and Bone</i>. It was a huge fantasy show and her salary hasn't been disclosed.&nbsp;</p><p>However, <i>Shadow and Bone</i> had a huge budget and it cost around <strong>$3 Million</strong> for every episode. Since Dasgupta&nbsp;is one of the important characters in the show, it would be safe to assume that she was paid well.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Dasgupta's Career Summary</h2><p>Dasgupta has already managed to make quite a name for herself despite being relatively newer in the movie industry. Her most popular work so far, in her short career has come through the TV series, <i>Shadow and Bone.&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/27/Screenshot%202023-03-27%20132621%20(1)-1679902943526.jpg><p>Dasgupta made her debut in <strong>2014</strong> with a short film called <i>Red Wolf </i>as per her <i>IMDb</i> page. Her next work came the following year with the show, <i>Doctors</i> where she played the role of Priya Sutaria for one episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The role of Veena Patel in <i>Guilt</i> was the first big role Dasgupta received. Since then, she has gone on to do shows like <i>Press, Casualty, </i>and<i> Shantaram.</i> She is yet to make her big screen debut at the time of this writing.</p><h2>Where Did Dasgupta Study At?</h2><p>Dasgupta came prepared to make a career as an actress as she has taken formal lessons in acting. She was a student at the Royal Centre School of Speech and Drama, which is a University located in London. She graduated in <strong>2015</strong>.</p><p><i>Shantaram</i> actress, Dasgupta has also taken formal English lessons. She did her studies at the University of Leicester where she graduated in <strong>2009</strong>. The actress readied herself in every way before stepping foot into the world of acting.</p><h2>Body Measurements - Height & Weight Of Dasgupta&nbsp;</h2><p>Sujaya is in incredible shape as her body measurements are<strong> 32-25-32 </strong>inches. She is a bit shorter than the average height as she stands at 5 Feet and 6 Inches (167 cm), the same as <a href=#><strong>Sara Eisen</strong></a>. The actress has a slim body that weighs 121 lbs (<strong>55 kg</strong>).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/27/178572128_777767969795180_1235979563957380624_n%20(1)-1679902431401.jpg><p>Dasgupta wears a dress of size <strong>4 (US)</strong> and shoes of size <strong>8 (US)</strong>. Being involved in the film industry, it is expected of you to be in a certain shape and the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> actress takes good care of her body.</p><h2>Who Are Dasgupta's Parents And A Sister?</h2><p>Dasgupta's father's name is Debopama Das Gupta Sen<strong> </strong>and her mother's name is Monica Gupta. She isn't the only child of theirs as she also has a sister. Her name is Joyita Das Gupta.</p><p>Debopama, Monica, and Joyita, all three have maintained a low-profile life and stay away from their daughter's limelight. Even, the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> actress, Dasgupta has not disclosed much information about her mom, dad, and sister.</p><h2>Has Done Theatre</h2><p>Dasgupta is not just an on-screen performer but a stage performer as well. She loves theatres and has been doing plays since the beginning of her career. She has been doing it before she even started acting in front of the cameras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/27/106299568_591891378197585_3478758070585257083_n%20(1)-1679903167937.jpg><p><i>The Good Karma Hospital</i> actress, Dasgupta has previously worked with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Royal & Derngate Theatre. Some of the plays she has done have been published by <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Tara Theatre</i> </a>on their website.&nbsp;</p><p>Dasgupta&nbsp;did <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns </i>at Birmingham Rep and Northern Stage and<i> Death of a Salesman</i> at Royal & Derngate.</p><h2>Dasgupta's Tweet That Caused A Huge Backlash&nbsp;</h2><p>Dasgupta lives a drama-free life hence, you don't hear any negative news surrounding her. But, she did receive a huge backlash for the tweet she made a while back. Her tweet regarding a sensitive topic, racism (which didn't seem like she was trying to attack anyone) didn't sit well with many people.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Shadow and Bone</i> actress, Dasgupta, like everyone else, tweeted about the issue of racism when the tension was high some time back. Her tweet highlighted the issue the black community face but she being a minority herself, further added that the racial discrimination other community faced are hardly talked about.</p><p>The tweet came at the wrong time and some defended Dasgupta saying she wasn't intending to offend anyone. Most people were upset with her tweet as they believed she was getting distracted from the issue. She is no longer on Twitter and it is unclear if this backlash was the reason behind her choosing to delete her account.</p><h2>Shadow and Bone Controversy</h2><p><i>Shadow and Bone</i> have been Sujaya Dasgupta's most recognizable work so far in her career. The show was widely well-received but it found itself in controversy about what happened behind the scene.</p><p>The stunt double of the Nepali British actor, <strong>Amita Suman</strong> was a white woman. She was painted brown for the show, <i>Shadow and Bone</i>.</p><figure class=media></figure><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Independent</i></a> has reported that the show makers hired a Hungarian stuntwoman, <strong>Vellai Krisztina</strong>, a white woman to do the action scenes of Suman. Once, the news came out, the outrage was huge and they let the makers know how they felt about this.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, learn about the dating history of <a href=#><strong>Ben Barnes</strong></a> who played General Kirigan in <i>Shadow and Bones.</i></p><h2>Has A Presence On Instagram</h2><p>Sujaya Dasgupta is present on the Internet through social media. You can find her on Instagram as she goes by the page <a href=# rel=nofollow>@sujaya_dasgupta</a>. But, she isn't much of a social media user as she hardly ever posts on the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Dasgupta doesn't like to share many details about her personal life. Her Instagram is mostly about her professional life as most of the posts are about her work. Other than that, there are very few pictures of her traveling to places like Venice and Vienna.</p><p><i>Like Sujaya Dasgupta's bio?
