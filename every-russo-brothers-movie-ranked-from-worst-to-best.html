Of course, they’re best known for their contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), including Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, but they’ve also filmed other non-Marvel movies as well.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false>Here’s a chronological list of all of them:</p><ul data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false><li>Welcome to Collinwood (2002)</li><li>You, Me and Dupree (2006)</li><li>Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</li><li>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</li><li>Avengers: Infinity War (2018)</li><li>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</li><li>Cherry (2021)</li><li>The Gray Man (2022)</li></ul><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Depending on your level of Marvel fandom, this list will either make you very happy or extremely annoyed that the Russo’s non-Marvel movies aren’t getting the love they deserve (a little foreshadowing for you). Here’s a ranked list of all their movies, from worst to best. Starting with, well, the worst.</p><h3 id=h-you-me-and-dupree data-injectable=false>You, Me and Dupree</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>There was a time in the mid 2000s when you couldn’t finance a movie without having Owen Wilson involved. He was in basically everything, and so of course he appears in this classic where the synopsis seems to be “add Wilson to this and it’ll be a hit.”</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>It kind of worked, as the movie made $130 million on a budget of $54 million, but neither audiences nor critics really sang its praises. It has a score of 20 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and a 50 percent audience score. It didn’t help that the plot was put together with old Hollywood tropes (the Odd Couple trope is a classic I guess).</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Even back then, critics felt like the Wilson schtick was wearing thin. In a review for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toronto Star</a>, critic Peter Howell said that “Owen Wilson is perilously close to doing a Dupree on his own career, by wearing out his welcome.”</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, the Russo brothers were just getting started.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Cherry</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>What do you do as an encore after you make the highest grossing film of all time? How about a heavy story about PTSD, bank robbing and addiction for Apple Plus? Giving Holland a chance to branch out from his usual superhero fare, Cherry follows Holland as a man with severe PTSD from war who robs banks to finance his drug addiction.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>While Holland was praised for his performance, critics complained that the movie was a little too formulaic and it sits at a 37 percent Tomatometer score. Randy Myers, the film critic at the San Jose Mercury News, said the Russos didn’t exactly nail this one.</p><p>“Holland flings himself into the role, and sweats desperation every second. But the Russos undermine him at every turn….”</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Honestly, making an artsy film about the effects of war and addiction is a good move but the directors didn’t exactly nail it.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The Gray Man</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>It was supposed to be a blockbuster spy thriller, and if you take out the word thriller and sub it with movie then it is. The pedigree on this movie is out of this world: Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana De Armas are all worth the price of admission (a Netflix account).</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>There are explosions, quips and Evans in a cop mustache. On the surface, everything’s there – except a good script. If you ignore that though, it’s kind of a fun movie. Almost more fun with the sound off. It’s a little hard, also, to know how this movie will be appreciated in a few years. Is it destined to become some a sort of cult classic? Probably not.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashable</a> critic Kristy Puchko said what a lot of critics also expressed – Netflix paid $200 million for a so-so movie.</p><p>It feels like a mixtape, pulling bits from a bunch of much better, much more daring action movies, to create a medley that is mediocre at best.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>The New York Post critic Johnny Oleksinski had some pointed words as well.</p><p>My barista could have been cast as the lead of this action-thriller, and the film would be absolutely no different.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Despite these brutal takedowns, the movie is one of Netflix’s most popular to date. Which means we’ll be seeing more of the Gray Man universe in the future. Which, depending on how you feel about the movie, is either great news or terrible news.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Welcome To Collinwood</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>The Russos first film is probably their least known, but it was the one that got them on the map. Starring a veritable who’s who of actors from the early 2000s, this slapstick heist movie features the brothers signature blend of action and humor.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>It also features George Clooney as a curmudgeonly safe cracker in a wheelchair. It’s a remake of a 1958 Italian movie called Big Deal on Madonna Street&nbsp;(I soliti ignoti). It has a few funny moments, but it wasn’t exactly a smash. As per usual, many critics, like Nick Schager from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matinee Magazine</a>, didn’t like the film.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>It was definitely enough to score another film for the Russos, but unfortunately that next movie was You, Me and Dupree.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Avengers: Infinity War</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The next four movies on the list are pretty obvious choices and also the best in the Russo catalog. They also happen to be the Brothers’ highest-grossing and widely seen films. Coincidence? Probably not.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Infinity War was an out and out smash, and ended on a cliffhanger so huge that it had reverberations all throughout the MCU. The cast was a comprehensive collection of Marvel stars in this movie, and it served as the ending of the Marvel Infinity Saga that started with Iron Man in 2008.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>There’s nothing really bad to say about this one (depending on how you feel about superhero movies). It acts as an archetype for all movies after it, and it’s just really… good. It almost makes You, Me and Dupree worth it. Why is it not on the top of the list? You’ll see.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Captain America: Civil War</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>This one’s hard to dislike. This was the first huge MCU movie after The Avengers in 2012, and it did not disappoint. The heroes were divided into two camps based around the regulations of superheroes. Some were into it, some were not.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>The Russos found their footing with this one and really swung for the fences. It worked. It’s tense, fast-paced and incredibly entertaining. It was also jam-packed with superheroes from all over the MCU, and the stakes never felt higher. It’s pound for pound one of the best Marvel movies ever.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>This one’s important because it’s the Marvel movie that The Russos first tackled. It shows that superhero movies can be more than just family popcorn fare — they can be rife with emotion, high-stakes and incredible writing. It’s a complex story well told with narrative beats that you would see in a tearjerker.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>The movie relies on character over spectacle, but the spectacle is incredible. It feels like an actual comic book come to life.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>A lot of people think this is one of the best Marvel movies, period, and its Rotten Tomatoes audience score reflects that with a rating of 92 percent. Critics agree with that sentiment and the film is Certified Fresh with a 90 percent.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Robert Sims from Lights Camera Austin singled out the Russos in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a>.</p><p>Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo go for broke not just in the way they stage some of the biggest and most impressive action sequences to be found in a Marvel film, but also in changing the course of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Avengers: Endgame</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>I don’t think it’s legally allowed to put this on any list of Marvel movies in any other slot than the top, much less a Russo Brothers list. It’s difficult to explain the impact this movie had. It was everywhere, and everything people talked about.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>It came out right before the pandemic so it didn’t have to deal with the theater issues that were on the way, and it featured every important Marvel superhero storyline, handling it beautifully. The cliffhanger from the previous film made for some of the most dramatic stakes to date as well.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>It made more money than a small country does in a month, breaking box office records left and right, and made more money than its predecessor in 11 days of its release. It is the second highest grossing film of all time behind Avatar — and the only reason that movie made more is because it was re released in China in 2021.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>All this is thanks to The Russos and their ability to take something originally intended for kids and make it universal, grown up and really poignant. Critics loved it too and its critic score is higher than the audience score — a rare instance for a superhero movie.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Oliver Jones, the critic from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a>, summed it up nicely:</p><p>“What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq56s8HSrKZmmqKkwamx0axkpqemnrJuvsCnop6cXZu%2FsLmMsKarq6RiwbB5wZ6qrWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html&text=Every%20Russo%20brothers%20movie%2c%20ranked%20from%20worst%20to%20best&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html&title=Every%20Russo%20brothers%20movie%2c%20ranked%20from%20worst%20to%20best" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html&title=Every%20Russo%20brothers%20movie%2c%20ranked%20from%20worst%20to%20best" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html&title=Every%20Russo%20brothers%20movie%2c%20ranked%20from%20worst%20to%20best" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-russo-brothers-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html&description=Every%20Russo%20brothers%20movie%2c%20ranked%20from%20worst%20to%20best" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./oscar-wilde-trials-downfall-gross-indecency.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Oscar Wilde's Libel Trial Backfired and Ruined His Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dunkin-chocolate-easter-eggs-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dunkin' Chocolate Easter Eggs Are Our New Favorite Candy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
