James felt Presley needed a more mature rock song to bring him back as a Tom Jones-style singer.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Both men felt 'Suspicious Minds' was perfect, and James urged others to get Elvis to hear it. After hearing the song, Elvis decided he could turn it into a hit.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=29><h2 class=title>How was the song recorded?</h2><figure>via GIPHY</figure><p class=paragraph-text>Elvis's 1969 recordings at American Sound Studio followed his successful '68 Comeback Special, which interested producer Chips Moman in making recordings in the King's new style of rock, gospel, country, rhythm & blues, and soul.</p><p class=paragraph-text>'Suspicious Minds' was recorded on January 23, 1969, between 4am and 7am.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It took eight takes to produce the full song, which also involved Elvis overdubbing himself on the same night.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Mark James was in Memphis at the time, but he was not at the recording session. He had walked into the recording studio a few days earlier, and felt that Elvis was uncomfortable with his presence. As he did not want to ruin things, he decided to stay away.</p><p class=paragraph-text>At first, James thought the new song sounded too slow. When he later heard the full version, he remarked he was "blown away". It is said that In later years, whenever Elvis saw James, he would cross the room to say 'hello'.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=5><h2 class=title>The song was almost never released</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The song was nearly halted over a copyright dispute. Elvis's business partners said they wanted half of Moman's publishing rights.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Moman then accused them of stealing, and Elvis's people threatened to stop the recording session. Harry Jenkins of RCA agreed with Elvis's people, as he sensed that the song would be a big hit.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=18><h2 class=title>Why does the song fade out and in again?</h2><figure>via GIPHY</figure><p class=paragraph-text>Elvis's main producer Felton Jarvis made the strange decision to add an early fade-out to the song at 3:36, lasting for 15 seconds before fading back in.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The first verse then continues until it completely fades out.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In 2012, Moman told The Wall Street Journal that Jarvis was never happy with Elvis recording at American Sound Studio, as "it was a control thing."</p><p class=paragraph-text>He added: "So when Jarvis took the tape of 'Suspicious Minds,' he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it. I have no idea why he did that, but he messed it up. It was like a scar. None of which mattered. Soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=2><h2 class=title>How did it perform in the charts?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The song was Elvis's final US number one before he died, and it also reached number two in the UK.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He was beaten to number one in the UK by 'Two Little Boys' by Rolf Harris.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=7><h2 class=title>Who has covered it?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/13iMsGNUHFo/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Fine Young Cannibals - Suspicious Minds (Official Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>In 1986, the Fine Young Cannibals released a cover featuring backing vocals by Jimmy Somerville, reaching number 8 in the UK.
