To prevent any such incidents from happening in the future, the LSU tightened security and issued new rules to keep the athletes safe.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqKKks6q4xGimpaGmnq5usNSnpZ4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-dunne.html&text=Olivia%20Dunne%20-%20News%2c%20Bio%2c%20Facts%20%28Updated%20on%20Mon%2c%20Dec%204%202023%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-dunne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-dunne.html&title=Olivia%20Dunne%20-%20News%2c%20Bio%2c%20Facts%20%28Updated%20on%20Mon%2c%20Dec%204%202023%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-dunne.html&title=Olivia%20Dunne%20-%20News%2c%20Bio%2c%20Facts%20%28Updated%20on%20Mon%2c%20Dec%204%202023%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-dunne.html&title=Olivia%20Dunne%20-%20News%2c%20Bio%2c%20Facts%20%28Updated%20on%20Mon%2c%20Dec%204%202023%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-dunne.html&description=Olivia%20Dunne%20-%20News%2c%20Bio%2c%20Facts%20%28Updated%20on%20Mon%2c%20Dec%204%202023%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-best-horror-movies-coming-to-shudder-in-december-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 7 best horror movies coming to Shudder in December 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lily-aldridge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lily Aldridge  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
